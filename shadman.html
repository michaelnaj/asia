                <p>This is my friend, Shadman. Shadman grew up in Roswell, Georgia. This interview was perhaps the most harrowing to conduct.
                Shadman tells his story, as a man with Bangladeshi origins, living in the South. He recounts instances where his skin colour
                defined him in both academic and societal settings. He tells of his skin colour affecting his identification with masculinity.
                He tells of his skin colour altering the way in which he perceives other peoples of colour. But mostly, he tells a narrative
                of a person not given the correct treatment as an individual simply because of the colour of his skin. Shadman wanted the
                interview to take place in his own home with his roommate. He said that this is a space in which he feels safe and able to
                discuss such troubling issues. He wanted the shot to be just of himself sitting comfortably in order to demonstrate that,
                despite such a disturbing experience as an Asian in the South, that he is confident and unbreakable.</p>

                <p>After the interview concluded, Shadman told me that his only wish for the video was to perhaps extend some solidarity to
                others who have experienced the same level of bigotry and prejudice and to show them that they are not alone.</p>
