                <p>This is my friend, Lexx. Like myself, Lexx has a rich heritage from many countries around the world. When I approached Lexx
                to discuss his heritage in relation to his experience in the American South he told me that he would like to take the time
                to discuss some matters extremely close to his heart. He declined to be interviewed straight out as he felt that, in relation
                to his heritage, he would best be able to convey his passion by preparing various speeches. When I told him about my class’s
                focus of Asia in the South Lexx decided that his video should include two different parts: one part concerning his experience
                as an Asian in the South, and one part about an issue facing his home country of South Korea. Despite being a Korean living
                in the United States, Lexx takes a great interest in matters affecting his historical homeland. One matter in particular
                that Lexx said he would like to raise awareness for is the environmental issues facing South Korea. And so, I did some research
                myself as, up until this point, I was completely unaware of the environmental problems and potential solutions of South Korea.</p>

                <p>One issue that is facing South Korea is water quality. But, over the last few decades, government officials have been devising
                ways to improve water quality in South Korea. Up until the 1970s, the water quality in South Korea was subpar due to the
                lack of a managed sewerage system and overall poor water management services. One tactic that South Korea has used in its
                water management plan is harvesting rainwater during its monsoon seasons. Rainwater has been described as the best source
                of drinking water in South Korea. Rainwater has also helped to save on energy for the country’s water supply. The government
                is seeking to eventually implement this system throughout thousands of islands around the country.</p>

                <p>As Westerners, it is easy to focus on our own issues and disregard even the notion of the plight of other countries, however,
                the reality is that all nations face difficulties (not only environmental ones). Moreover, when dealing with issues such
                as the environment it is critical to remember that change, or lack thereof, effects the entire world. Lexx informed me of
                a specific example of this -- the “Asian Dust” coming from Chinese desserts that pollutes the air in Korea. As a global society,
                it is our duty to address these issues for the sake of humanity as a whole. While Lexx discussed the many ways in which the
                South Korean government is working to combat environmental problems (and succeeding), the point of this video is to generally
                raise awareness, especially considering the horrific stance that the USA’s current government takes on climate change.s</p>

                <p>Although the one primary focus of my project is the environment, it soon became clear after conducting a few interviews that
                what I wanted to do was to delve deeper into the experience of a person of Asian heritage in the American South. While being
                at Duke, I have encountered many instances of racism and prejudice. It seems that many people in the South do not see the
                harm that can be caused by what they deem to be “casual kidding around”. Microaggressions and the perpetuation of stereotypes
                (be them positive or negative) occur regularly. When I asked Lexx to speak about his experience he informed me that he would
                like to use the time on camera to reach out and show that those suffering are not alone and to illustrate that people will
                take a stand against bigotry.</p>
