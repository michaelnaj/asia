                <p>This is my friend, Puj. When I approached him to speak about his experience growing up in the South as an Asian he decided
                that what he really wanted to do was to tell a story, an anecdote that he felt sums up his experience. While the story being
                told is ostensibly comedic and told in a light-hearted manner, it is, in fact, deeply disturbing and quite sinister. Puj
                tells of an individual according to whom all non-white people are “Mexican”. Puj says that at no time did he feel as if the
                individual was attempting to be racist or aggressive in any way, he was simply so ignorant of the outside world that his
                perception was so clearly muddied. While one might argue that this ignorance is nothing more than a product of a generation
                gap, it is important to remember that it still carries and perpetuates bigotry and intolerance. Ignorance is passed down
                from generation to generation and it is the responsibility of our education system to broaden the minds of our youth in order
                to create a society where all races and colours are recognised, and not crudely lumped together under the umbrella term of
                “minorities” -- or “Mexicans”.</p>
